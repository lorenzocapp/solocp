solocp includes a fast Bayesian change point detection methodology based on spike and slab priors.

Installation
------------

1.  Install the package `devtool'

2.  Load `devtools` using `library(devtools)`.

3.  Install `solocp` using

    1.  `install_github("lorenzocapp/solocp")`, or

    2.  `install_github("lorenzocapp/solocp", build_vignettes = TRUE)` if you want some illustrative vignettes (note: using `build_vignettes = TRUE` will make the install take longer).

Vignettes
---------

1.  [solocp_simulated_data](https://github.com/lorenzocapp/solocp/blob/main/vignettes/solocp_vignette.Rmd): A short tutorial to describe the basics functioning of the package (Link will change).

Numerical Experiments in the Manuscript
----------

The draft includes several numerical experiments. These can be found at this [link](https://github.com/lorenzocapp/solocp_experiments). While they are based on the same methodology, they rely on a less user-friendly implementation of the functions included in this package.
